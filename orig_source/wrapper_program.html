<h2>Wrapper program</h2>

<p>Since <code>rw.dll</code> is a library, it cannot be run directly. In order to debug
<code>authentication_1</code> and examine the memory dump, I have created a wrapper
program. This program tries to call a library exported function as follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load the library (<code>rw.dll</code>)</li>
<li>Locate the address of a given function (<code>authentication_1</code>)</li>
<li>Type cast the address to accept parameters (In <code>authentication_1</code>, there are 4)</li>
<li>Call the function</li>
</ol>


<p>In debugger (x32dbg/OllyDbg), set a breakpoint in <code>main</code> and start stepping
over instructions. When the program loads the <code>rw.dll</code>, the entry function
is called in the library which does several initialisation and calls constructors.
One of the constructors (<code>0x10012430</code>) is a global class located in <code>0x10073ed8</code>.
This class is used throughout the library and will be discussed later.</p>

<p><em>A snippet of the constructor</em></p>

<p>After that, the wrapper gets the address of <code>authentication_1</code>. This is achieved
by looking up the exported functions table from <code>rw.dll</code>. Then, type-cast the
address to a function that takes 4 arguments.</p>

<p><code>c
typedef void (__cdecl *pFunIIII)(int, int, int, int);
// [...]
HINSTANCE hGetProcIDDLL = LoadLibrary(TEXT("rw.dll"))
FARPROC procAddr = GetProcAddress((HMODULE) hGetProcIDDLL, "authentication_1");
pFunIIII func = (pFunIIII)procAddr;
// [...]
func(param_1, param_2, param_3, param_4);
</code></p>

<p>The code can be found in Appendix &hellip; TODO: Edit Appendix</p>

<p>At a later stage of analysis, this wrapper program is not sufficient to examine
the function. <code>authentication_1</code> has a lot of function calls within functions.
It is not time efficient to analyse a particular function from the beginning,
especially when the function is deep (i.e. it is being called after several jumps).
Hence, I modified the wrapper function to not only calls exported function, but an
address. Given an address, the wrapper can directly calls it.</p>
